# React Assignment

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-react)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) â€“ for fast refresh and SWC

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. You can refer to the [Vite + React + TypeScript + ESLint template](https://github.com/igorskyflyer/vite-react-ts-eslint) for a working example.
